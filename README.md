# Pleco-Kangxi-Radicals-Flashcards
Flashcards for Pleco Kangxi Radicals.

Flashcards are based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(Chinese_characters)#Unicode .
I just went through all 214 wikipedia pages and copy and pasted the character, definition and pinyin.

If a character has an additional character "without additional strokes" I but it inside the definition as "Alt.:".

Example: Radical 47
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_47

Simplified:   巛
Traditional:  巛
Pinyin:       chuān
Definition:   river
              Alt.:巜 川
              
Some Characters have two or three pinyins. Don't ask me why, I don't understand. I just copied. 
Also I am not a 100% sure what this alternative appearance really means.

Have fun learning :)
